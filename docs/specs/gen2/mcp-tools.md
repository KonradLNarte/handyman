# RESONANSIA MCP SERVER — GEN 2 SPEC

> Part of [Gen2 Spec](index.md)

## 3. MCP TOOL INTERFACE

### 3.1 Design principles

These principles override implementation convenience:

1. **Outcome over operation** — Tools represent agent goals, not database operations. An agent should accomplish its intent in 1-2 tool calls, not 5.
2. **Flat arguments** — Top-level primitives and constrained types. No nested dicts as params.
3. **5-15 tools total** — Curate ruthlessly. Each tool has one clear purpose.
4. **Every mutation emits an event** — Automatic. The caller does not need to emit events separately. The event is created FIRST, then fact tables are projected.
5. **Every mutation returns the created/modified entity** — No need for a follow-up read.
6. **Errors enable self-correction** — Error messages tell the agent what went wrong and how to fix it.
7. **Epistemic defaults** — `capture_thought` creates `hypothesis` entities. `store_entity` creates `asserted` entities. Agents can promote status explicitly.
8. **Reflexive ontology** — Type nodes are queryable through the same tools as data nodes. An agent that knows how to `explore_graph` already knows how to discover the schema. `get_schema` is a convenience shortcut, not a separate system. Gen1 must not introduce a parallel type registry that diverges from the graph.

# ─── ENTITY MANAGEMENT ───

store_entity:
  description: "Create or update an entity in the knowledge graph. Returns the full entity with ID. Creates an event FIRST, then projects to nodes table."
  params:
    entity_type: string            # type node name, e.g. "lead", "booking"
    data: object                   # entity fields as flat JSON
    entity_id: string?             # if provided, updates existing (creates new version)
    expected_version: datetime?    # optimistic concurrency: valid_from of the version being updated. If provided and does not match current version, returns CONFLICT error. See INV-CONCURRENCY.
    valid_from: datetime?          # backdate business time (default: now)
    epistemic: string?             # 'asserted' (default) or 'confirmed'. Never 'hypothesis' — use capture_thought for that.
    tenant_id: string?             # required only if token spans multiple tenants
  returns:
    entity_id: string
    entity_type: string
    data: object

    epistemic: string
    valid_from: datetime
    event_id: string               # the event that created this projection
    previous_version_id: string?
  auto_side_effects:
    - creates event (intent_type: "entity_created" or "entity_updated")
    - projects to nodes table with created_by_event reference
    - queues async embedding generation
    - validates data against type node schema if schema defined
    - if expected_version provided and does not match current version: returns CONFLICT error (no event created)

    - exact JSON Schema for params (in Zod notation matching tech profile)
    - exact JSON Schema for return value
    - exact error codes with message templates
    - exact event payload schema for each emitted event

    sort_by: string?               # "relevance" (default for semantic) | "created_at"
  filter_operators: |
    Filters support the following operators applied to JSONB data fields:
      { "field": "value" }              — equality (shorthand, default)
      { "field": { "$eq": "value" } }   — explicit equality
      { "field": { "$contains": "sub" } } — text contains (case-insensitive)
      { "field": { "$gte": 100 } }      — greater than or equal
      { "field": { "$lte": 200 } }      — less than or equal
      { "field": { "$in": ["a","b"] } } — value in set
      { "field": { "$exists": true } }  — field exists in JSONB
    [RESOLVED:gen1 D-010] Gen1 supports equality + $in only.
    [DECIDE:gen2] Add $gte, $lte, $contains, $exists operators.

    event_id: string
  auto_side_effects:
    - creates event (intent_type: "entity_removed") FIRST
    - sets is_deleted=true, valid_to=now() on node

  implementation_notes: |
    1. Fetch tenant's type nodes (available entity types + schemas)
    2. Call LLM to extract: type classification, structured fields, mentioned entities, action items
    3. For each mentioned entity: DEDUPLICATE before creating
       - Search existing entities by name similarity (embedding + fuzzy text match)
       - If match confidence > threshold: link to existing entity
       - If match confidence < threshold: create new entity as 'hypothesis'
       - Return match_confidence in response for transparency
    4. Create primary node via store_entity (with epistemic override to 'hypothesis')
    5. Create edges between primary node and mentioned/found entities
    6. Emit event: "thought_captured"
    LLM must be type-node-aware: prompt includes tenant's available types and their schemas.

    # ── SYSTEM MESSAGE ──────────────────────────────────────────
    # Sent as the system/developer message. Variables in {braces} are interpolated at runtime.

    You are a structured entity extraction agent for the "{tenant_name}" knowledge graph.
    Your task: given free-text input, extract structured entities, relationships, and action items.

    RULES:
    - Output ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no explanation, no commentary.
    - Classify entities using ONLY the types listed below. If no type fits, use "note".
    - Map text attributes to the type's schema fields. Omit fields you cannot confidently extract.
    - For mentioned entities, check the EXISTING ENTITIES list for potential matches.
      Set existing_match_id to the ID if you are confident it's the same entity (>80% sure).
      Set it to null if unsure or no match. Never guess an ID — when in doubt, set null.
    - Relationships MUST use edge types from the AVAILABLE EDGE TYPES list.
    - Action items are optional. Only include clear, actionable next steps implied by the text.
    - All extracted data reflects what the text STATES. Do not infer facts not present in the input.
    - If the input is too vague to extract any entity, return the FALLBACK structure (see below).

    AVAILABLE ENTITY TYPES:
    {entity_types_block}
    # Runtime interpolation produces:
    #   - name: "lead"
    #     description: "A potential customer or contact"
    #     schema:
    #       required: [name]
    #       properties:
    #         name: { type: string }
    #         phone: { type: string }
    #         email: { type: string }
    #         interest: { type: string }
    #         source: { type: string }
    #   - name: "booking"
    #     ...
    # Include ALL entity type nodes for the tenant. Max ~20 types at gen1 scale.

    AVAILABLE EDGE TYPES:
    {edge_types_block}
    # Runtime interpolation produces:
    #   - name: "contacted_via"
    #     description: "Communication channel between entities"
    #   - name: "includes"
    #     ...

    EXISTING ENTITIES (potential deduplication targets):
    {existing_entities_block}
    # Runtime interpolation: fetch top 20 entities by embedding similarity to input text.
    # Format per entity:
    #   - id: "uuid-here"
    #     type: "lead"
    #     name: "Johan Eriksson"
    #     summary: "Interested in cabin renovation, source: cabin fair"
    # If no existing entities, this section reads: "(none)"

# ─── DISCOVERY ───

get_schema:
  description: "Discover what entity types, relationship types, and event types exist in a tenant. Returns type nodes with their schemas and usage counts. Use this first to understand the data model before querying. Note: this is a convenience tool — the same information is available via explore_graph(start_id=METATYPE_NODE) or find_entities(entity_types=['type_node'])."
  params:
    tenant_id: string?
  returns:
    entity_types: [{ name, schema, node_count, example_fields, type_node_id }]

  implementation_constraint: |
    get_schema MUST query the nodes table (where type_node_id = metatype), not a separate
    registry or hardcoded view. This preserves the reflexive property: type nodes are nodes,
    and any tool that works on nodes also works on type nodes. If a type node is created via
    store_entity, it must immediately appear in get_schema results without additional sync.

### 3.4 Projection matrix (event → fact table mutations)

This matrix defines how each event `intent_type` maps to mutations on fact tables. It is the skeleton of the event-sourcing engine. Gen1-spec MUST expand each row into full pseudocode; gen1-impl translates pseudocode to executable code.

```
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# PROJECTION MATRIX — gen1.1 expanded pseudocode
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# Format: intent_type → full pseudocode for event + fact table mutations.
# All mutations happen within a single database transaction (INV-ATOMIC, §3.5).
# Variables prefixed with $ are runtime values. $now = clock_timestamp().
# $actor = resolved actor node_id (§4.6). $tenant = resolved tenant_id.
#
# CONVENTION: every projection function returns the created/modified rows
# so the tool handler can build the response without a follow-up query.

  edge_cases:
    - Object storage upload succeeds but DB transaction fails: orphaned blob in storage.
      Mitigation: gen1-impl SHOULD implement a cleanup job or accept the orphan (storage
      is cheap). The upload happens pre-tx because it's an external side effect.
    - No related_entity_id: blob is standalone (e.g., a template document).
  errors:
    - E002 if related_entity_id provided but not found
    - E003 if scope denied
    - E009 if object storage upload fails
```

**Completeness check:** Every `intent_type` in the events table CHECK constraint (§2.1) has a matching projection entry above: `entity_created`, `entity_updated`, `entity_removed`, `edge_created`, `edge_removed`, `epistemic_change`, `thought_captured`, `grant_created`, `grant_revoked`, `blob_stored`. [gen1.1: completeness verified]

### 3.5 Transaction boundaries and error model

This section defines how mutations maintain consistency between the event layer and the fact layer.

```yaml
# ── TRANSACTION MODEL ──

principle: |
  Every mutation follows the same pattern:
  1. VALIDATE — check permissions, resolve types, verify constraints (outside tx)
  2. EXTERNAL CALLS — LLM extraction, entity search for deduplication (outside tx, capture_thought only)
  3. BEGIN TRANSACTION
  4. WRITE EVENT — INSERT into events table
  5. PROJECT — INSERT/UPDATE fact tables (nodes, edges, grants)
  6. COMMIT TRANSACTION
  7. ASYNC SIDE EFFECTS — queue embedding generation, notifications (outside tx)

  If step 5 fails, step 4 is rolled back. No orphaned events exist. (See INV-ATOMIC.)
  If step 7 fails, the entity exists but may lack embeddings temporarily. This is acceptable.

failure_modes:
  validation_failure:
    description: "Input doesn't pass schema/auth checks"
    behavior: "Return error immediately, no event created, no DB writes"
    examples: ["invalid entity_type", "missing required field", "auth denied"]

  projection_failure:
    description: "Event is valid but fact table write fails (constraint violation, FK error)"
    behavior: "ROLLBACK entire transaction including event. Return error with details."
    examples: ["EXCLUDE constraint on overlapping valid ranges", "FK to nonexistent type_node"]

  concurrency_conflict:
    description: "expected_version does not match current version"
    behavior: "Return CONFLICT error with current version info. No event created."
    examples: ["Two agents updating same lead simultaneously"]

  external_call_failure:
    description: "LLM or embedding API call fails"
    behavior: |
      - capture_thought LLM failure: return error, no entities created
      - Embedding generation failure: entity is created without embedding, embedding is retried via async queue
      - Embedding failures MUST NOT prevent entity creation (embeddings are eventual)

  partial_capture_thought:
    description: "LLM extraction succeeds but one of multiple entity/edge inserts fails"
    behavior: "ROLLBACK entire transaction. All-or-nothing for the capture. Return error with extraction result so agent can retry or store manually."
